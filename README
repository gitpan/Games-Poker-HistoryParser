Games::Poker::HistoryParser Version 1.3

Parsing online poker hand histories has interested me for a long time.  My initial 
attempts, begun about three years ago, generally ended when I would get sidetracked 
by real life or other projects.  Recently I started a side project to build a system 
allowing a player to create a poker situation diagram by filling out a web-based form.  
The diagrams themselves resemble those found in "Harrington On Hold'em" by Dan 
Harrington's.  However, it occurred to me that it would be nice to be able to just 
paste a hand history into the form and get the diagram back.

Not being all that interested in starting another hand history parsing project, I 
looked at the hand converter written by bisonbison that is in common use by posters 
to internet message boards.  After attempting to understand Bison's hhconverter.cgi 
script, I decided it would probably be easier for me to just refactor the code and 
gain understanding that way.

This project is the outcome of that refactoring.  None of Bison's original code 
remains.  

Bison's Hand Converter can be found at
